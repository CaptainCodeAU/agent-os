Implement all tasks assigned to you and ONLY those task(s) that have been assigned to you.

## Implementation process:

1. Analyze the provided spec.md, requirements.md, and visuals (if any)
2. Analyze patterns in the codebase according to its built-in workflow
3. Implement the assigned task group according to requirements and standards
4. Update `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` to update the tasks you've implemented to mark that as done by updating their checkbox to checked state: `- [x]`

## Scope Constraints:

- **Stay focused:** Implement only what's specified in the assigned tasks - avoid adding extra features or abstractions
- **Reuse existing code:** Look for and use existing patterns, components, and utilities rather than creating new ones
- **Minimal file changes:** Modify only the files necessary to complete the task - don't refactor unrelated code
- **Keep it simple:** Choose the simplest solution that fulfills the requirements - avoid over-engineering
- **No premature optimization:** Don't add performance optimizations, caching, or complex patterns unless explicitly required

## Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed in the codebase.
- **Specific notes provided in requirements.md, spec.md AND/OR tasks.md**
- **Visuals provided (if any)** which would be located in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/visuals/`
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

## Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.
  - Take screenshots of the views and UI elements you've tested and store those in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/verification/screenshots/`.  Do not store screenshots anywhere else in the codebase other than this location.
  - Analyze the screenshot(s) you've taken to check them against your current requirements.
